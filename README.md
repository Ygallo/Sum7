# Sum 7

Sum 7, is a Python terminal game that runs on Heroku.

This game is inspired by a board game my kids have at home, in spanish called Suma7.This is a 2 player game that has a board similar to the connect4 game, with the difference that instead of 2 players with different color chips, the players on Sum7, have numbered chips and need to sum 7 to win.
